***Harry Cheung***: I am a fourth year student at the University of Waterloo studying Geomatics with a Computing Minor. By drawing connections and making applications from the models to our real-time observations, I believe we can derive solutions that can appeal to public and private interests while initiating conversations on how we can better improve our communities, cities, and the world around us. I enjoy playing board games and going on long walks.
